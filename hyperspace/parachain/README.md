# Hyperspace Parachain

This crates adds support for parachains to hyperspace relayer.

## Parachain Config

The parachain config contains all the parameters required to create a parachain client.  

The following list explains the function of each parameter:  

- `name` - A string that can be used to identify the parachain.

- `para_id` - The parachain Id.

- `parachain_rpc_url` - A web socket url that connects to the parachain rpc node.

- `relay_chain_rpc_url` - A web socket url that connects to the relaychain rpc node.

- `client_id` - An optional ClientId.

- `connection_id` - An optional connection Id.

- `beefy_activation_block` - The beefy activation block, should be defined if using the beefy finality protocol.

- `commitment_prefix` - UTF8 string bytes that represent the connection prefix.

- `private_key` - The private key for signing transactions. 

- `ss58_version` - Parachain's ss58 version number as specified in the ss58 registry. 

- `channel_whitelist` - A list of channel and ports to relay packets from and to. 

- `finality_protocol` - The finality protocol for this parachain is using, could be either beefy or grandpa. 

- `key_type` - The digital signature scheme for the private key used, one of `ecdsa`, `sr25519`, `ed25519`. 

## Parachain Client

The parachain client implements the `Chain` trait alongside all other required traits.

A couple things to note when using the relayer is that the client id and channel whitelist must be set before starting  
the relayer. If the client Id is not set, the relayer will panic when it tries to access it.  
The channel whitelist should also be set before packets can be relayed, the relayer only relays packets for whitelisted  
channels, if that list is empty no packets will be relayed.  


## Runtime Metadata

The parachain client depends on autogenerated runtime metadata by subxt codegen both for the relaychain and parachain runtimes.  
The recommended approach is to generate these types from live nodes of both chains by using the  build script which is enabled using the  
feature flag `build-metadata-from-ws`, if running the build script is not desired, then the types can be statically generated and written  
to `utils/subxt/generated/src/parachain.rs` and `utils/subxt/generated/src/rococo.rs` for the parachain and relay chain respectively.
